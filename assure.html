      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <h3>Users have a difficult time finding our products.</h3>

      <p>
        Sexual harassment is a problem many individuals face throughout their lives. It includes unwelcome,
        inappropriate sexual remarks or unwanted physical advances.
      </p>

      <p>
        People may face sexual harassment in many settings - in public, at work, in social situations, and at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are limited to what problems we can solve with a technological solution, so we have identified the following
        as problems related to sexual harassment:

      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>People are afraid to walk at night by themselves.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>People aren’t sure how to protect themselves when they’re uncomfortable.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>People don’t have a way to recover from traumatizing events.</strong>
      </p>

      <h1>User Research</h1>
      <h2>Understanding the problem space</h2>

      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>
        We conducted <strong>6 interviews</strong> to get anecdotal information regarding sexual harrassment.
      </p>
      <p>For example, we asked: "Have you ever felt afraid of going out on your own? When? Why?" and
        "What protective measures do you normally take" </p>

      <h3>Surveys</h3>
      <p>
        We received <strong>126 responses</strong> on our survey which consisted of more quantitative responses.
      </p>
      <p>For example, we asked:
        "How safe do you feel walking alone during the day? Night time?" and
        "How likely are you to report an incident of sexual harassment?"</p>

      <h1>Key Findings</h1>
      <h2>The presence of other people helps thwart potential advances.</h2>

      <p>
        Respondents noted that walking with someone is one of the most effective protective measures against sexual
        harassment.
      </p>



      <h2>Participants avoid walking at night and/or in dangerous areas.</h2>

      <p>
        61% of respondents feel unsafe walking at night. To combat the feeling of unsafety, they avoid walking at night
        or walking in areas that they understand to be dangerous.
      </p>

      <h2>There's not enough time to react in incidents of sexual harassment.</h2>
      <p>In the free response section, some participants noted that the shock they experience from an incident doesn't
        allow them to fully process and respond to the perpatrator(s).
      </p>


      <h2>Reporting to authorities is not necessary.</h2>


      <p>
        48% of respondents are not so likely to report an incident of harassment. They instead want to talk to family or
        friends to cope with it.
      </p>

      <h2>Live Tracking and Check In</h2>

      <p>
        Our respondents said that they feel unsafe walking at night and confide in family or friends when feeling
        uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that not everyone can avoid these situations, so we came up with a live tracking idea where users
        can alert their emergency contacts to keep an eye on their location.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, offer a check-in system where users can check in with their emergency contacts at regular time
        intervals.

      <h2>Panic Alert</h2>

      <p>
        Respondents mentioned that there is little time to react in the event of sexual harrassment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using an IoT device, we planned to have users press a button to blare a loud sound and deter assailants, and
        would also alert emergency contacts that the user is in danger.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, the app would record the time, date, and location to save information for potential incident
        reports.

      <h2>
        Live Tracking
      </h2>
      <p>
        With live tracking, users can input where they're heading and the system would periodically check in to make
        sure they're safe. Or, they can immediately turn on live tracking to alert their loved ones that they're feeling
        unsafe and to check in on them.

      </p>


      <p>
        While their loved ones may not be with them in-person, having their <strong>presence and
          acknowledgement</strong> at the other end of the line can provide added reassurance and sense of security
        since these contacts can be more equipped to respond.
      </p>


      <p>
        Live tracking can either be used on the mobile app or the IoT device. The IoT device can be used to send a
        check-in or contact the authorities in case of an emergency.

        After an incident, whether or not it was recorded through Assure’s live-tracking feature, can still be reported.
        These reports aren’t official reports that are sent to authorities.

      <p>

        Instead, these are <strong>self-reports</strong> that can either be used for future reference or, with the

        The MVP
      </h1>

      <p>
        Our original MVP was supposed to be a Kickstarter but we quickly had to rethink this goal since it would take
        multiple days for it to be approved. Instead, we created a <strong>website to garner attention to the
          idea</strong> of our product in the meantime.

      </p>

      <p>
        Within our product hypothesis, we stated that Assure will solve the lack of resources and support available to
        individuals who may be at risk or have experienced sexual harassment. We have found through our surveys and
        interviews that many early adopters see a true need for this type of product.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          Our prototype was vital in getting feedback on the type of application that our audience needed.
        </strong>
        Our website will help to serve as our main form of advertisement of our product to garner attention and
        further connect to our audience while we theoretically work to implement our mobile application and IoT wearable
        device.

        Lessons Learned
      </h1>

      <h2>Learning about the problem space</h2>
      <p>
        Many people approach sexual harrassment differently. I've had countless experiences feeling unsafe when I'm
        alone in unfamiliar areas. It was great to hear from so many different people about how they approach the
        situation and how we could help build a product that would satisfy their needs.

      </p>

      <h2>Product strategy</h2>
      <p>
        I learned a lot about creating a product that is not only usable, but also of value and solves actual user
        needs. After conducting interviews and surveys, we had very good insights about what potential users would want
        to see in an application that would make them feel safer.
      </p>

      <h2>Developing an MVP</h2>
      <p>
        Creating an MVP is not a one-and-done task. After conducting prototype testing, we had to redefine our MVP - we
        had to fail. We had to determine fail points, realign value propositions, adjust based on our time constraints,
        and realize missed opportunities. After doing this, we were able to build an MVP that would have value to our
        potential customers.
