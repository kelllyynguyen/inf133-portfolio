                <h2>Project Brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Assure is a mobile application and wearable that addresses concerns of sexual harassment. If you’ve
                    ever felt wary walking out at night by yourself, unsure of how to protect yourself from a harasser,
                    or want a space to communicate with others who’ve gone through similar situations, Assure aims to
                    provide solutions to address these very problems. Currently, there is a lack of resources as well as
                    support available for individuals who may be at risk or who have experienced some form of sexual
                    harassment. Our product aims to fill that gap by providing a set of features that help a user to
                    prevent, protect, and recover from incidents of sexual harassment.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    My main role for this project was a developer. I shortly worked with iOS Swift to build the mobile
                    app, but as our MVP pivoted, we decided to build an advertisement website for our MVP instead. In
                    addition to development, I researched competitors, conducted interviews and surveys, and made
                    important design decisions for the prototype.

                    <p>
                        We created a list of questions we wanted to ask the interviewees that would help us address our
                        goals. For example, we asked:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have you ever felt afraid of going out on your own? When? Why?</li>
                            <li> What protective measures do you normally take?</li>
                        </ul>
                        My group did a total of <b>6 interviews</b> that helped us understand our users' challenges and
                        approaches better. The data collected included people’s responses to our questions.

                        We started by defining goals and creating a list of questions for the survey. The questions on
                        the survey were broken down into 3 sections - General Info, Personal Experience and Witnessing.
                        Questions included:
                        <ul>
                            <li>How safe do you feel to walk alone during the day/night? </li>
                            <li>If you have experienced sexual harassment, where did it take place? (optional — feel
                                free to omit this if you are not comfortable)</li>
                        </ul>
                        We received a total of <b>126 responses</b> for the survey. Answers varied based on the
                        questions that
                        were either multiple choice, Likert scale, or short answer.

                        participant's responses written. Here were the findings:
                        <ul>

                            <li>People find that reporting incidents is <b>unnecessary</b>. They instead talk to friends
                                or
                                family to cope with it.</li>

                        With live tracking,
                        users can input where they're heading and the system would periodically check in to make sure
                        they're safe. Or, they can immediately turn on live tracking to alert their loved ones that
                        they're feeling unsafe and to check in on them.

                    <p>
                        While their loved ones may not be with them in-person, having their <b>presence and
                            acknowledgement</b> at the other end of the line can provide added reassurance and sense of
                        security
                        since these contacts can be more equipped to respond.

                        Live tracking can either be used on the mobile app or the IoT device. The IoT device can be used

                    Our original MVP was supposed to be a Kickstarter but we quickly had to rethink this goal since it

                    Kickstarter without any advertisements or promotional videos. So instead, we created a website to
                    garner attention to the idea of our product in the meantime.

                <p><b>Our prototype was vital in getting feedback on the type of application that
                        our audience needed.</b> Without the constant iterations of bettering our prototype, we would
                    not know
                    the exact features our primary users would utilize most or how they would best navigate the
                    application.

                <p>Our website will help to serve as our main form of advertisement of our product to
                    garner attention and further connect to our audience while we theoretically work to implement our
                    mobile application and IoT wearable device.</p>

                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <strong>Learning about the problem space</strong>
                <p>Many people approach sexual harrassment differently. As a woman, I've had countless experiences
                    feeling unsafe when I'm alone in unfamiliar areas. It was great to hear from so many different
                    people about how they approach the situation and how we could help build a product that would
                    satisfy their needs.</p>

                <strong>Product strategy</strong>
                <p>
                    I learned a lot about creating a product that is not only usable, but also of value and solves
                    actual user needs. After conducting interviews and surveys, we had very good insights about what
                    potential users would want to see in an application that would make them feel safer.

                <strong>Process of developing an MVP</strong>
                <p>
                    Creating an MVP is not a one-and-done task. After conducting prototype testing, we had to redefine
                    our MVP - we had to fail. We had to determine fail points, realign value propositions, adjust based
                    on our time constraints, and realize missed opportunities. After doing this, we were able to build
                    an MVP that would have value to our potential customers.
