        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Doodle is an online calendar tool best utilized for time management and planning group sessions. Targeted for
          people that need to collaborate, this product allows groups to set their availability and displays what times
          are most convenient for the majority of the team. Doodle has made it easier to solve the problem of figuring
          out the best time to meet, but it isn't a top choice for scheduling purposes. Therefore, my team and I wanted
          to create a redesign for Doodle using a user-centered design process. We conducted surveys, interviews, and
          usability tests and designed redesigned mockups based on our findings.

        </p>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          My role was a UX Designer. I collaborated with 5 other group members to complete this redesign. I was involved
          in the surveying and interviewing processes to understand how users schedule with others. I synthesized the
          data and
          helped determine which features needed redesigning. I drew sketches and created high-fidelity mockups to
          reflect
          the changes.

          Our study objectives are specific things that we

            Interviews
          </div>
          <p>
            Our in-person interview was comprised of two sections: <b>general questions</b> and
            <b>application-specific
              questions</b>.
            We also included a section for people who had no familiarity with scheduling applications. On average, our
            in-person interviews were 30 minutes long.
          </p>
          <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
          <div class="header-dark">Surveys</div>
          <p>Our survey questions were very similar to our in-person interview questions, but rephrased to obtain
            <b>quantitative data</b>. We asked questions that considered the individual’s position when coordinating
            (e.g.
            planner, participant, or both) to see if there were any relationships with their position and methods or
            preferred application.

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Usability Tests</div>

          <p>
            Our goals for the usability tests were to see how participants utilize different views and functionalities
            for each task.
            We focused on six tasks, half were focused on poll creation and half on poll participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first task had users create a text poll to make a tally of cake flavors for an office
            party. This allowed users to use Doodle as a poll service in addition to an event scheduling tool. The next
            two tasks asked the participants to create
            scheduled slot times with certain restrictions. The last three tasks were simple; they prompted the
            participants to pick preferred options in different types of polls.

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <strong>User Research</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <div class="subsection">

          <div class="header-dark">Group Size and System Preferences</div>
          <p>
            Many participants had a preferred system for coordinating meetings with others. About 50% of participants
            said they directly message people to coordinate plans instead of using a scheduling service. We reached
            the conclusion that these groups are small enough that finding a time to meet is enough without a
            scheduling application. Of the participants that coordinate with a larger number of people, they used a
            scheduling service, such as when2meet. This brought an interesting notion to our research that people use
            scheduling applications for more “business-like” meetings and direct message for casual groupings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Figure 1</b> below shows that people who have coordinated and/or participated in certain events have a
            preferred system they use in order to coordinate specific times to meet up. Those who had participated in
            a number of different types of events generally had used a scheduling service in order to keep track of
            their availability.

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">The Effect of Uncooperative People on Coordination</div>
          <p>
            Because group meetings depend on the participants, meeting coordinators have a difficult time with
            uncooperative people. This could be a limitation in the other members’ schedules because of available
            meeting times. We came to this conclusion from asking “What is challenging about coordinating a time to
            meet with others?. Their responses can be seen in <b>Figure 2</b> with a world cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agreeing on the date is another major problem, as
            some people can be unresponsive or have a lack of commitment. In this context, we define scheduling as
            coordinating group meetings using a given application. There are some pain points that are attributed to
            the features (or lack of) in a certain application. One participant said that having to coordinate across
            application platforms to view availabilities is hard when individuals’ schedules change.

          <p>
            Another sentiment a few of the participants interviewed expressed is that they like to keep their schedule
            organized. Many said that they view their schedule or calendar on a weekly, sometimes even hourly basis.
            We concluded that they want to organize their schedules in such a way that would make it easy to know when
            they are available for group meetings. A good portion of the participants use Google Calendar or a
            physical planner to keep track of their availability. Of the 19 participants that use a scheduling
            application, more than half used a physical/digital calendar, seen in <b>Figure 3</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to sync schedules across multiple platforms interested the interviewees. One of the interview
            questions read, “Is calendar integration important to you?” to which five of the thirteen participants
            responded yes. The team deduced that the reason for interest comes from recurring events that students
            have, such as club meetings, classes, and group events. Users need to keep track of their personal
            schedule, and an online calendar was the most common scheduling tool among respondents.

            We asked our participants if they would like to have notifications when using a scheduling application. To
            which most of our interviewees said that they prefer to have notifications (high frequency words
            “automatically” and “upcoming” are displayed in <b>Figure 4</b>). However, some stated that they preferred
            application notifications, and some stated that they preferred email notifications. One participant even
            stated that they wished their current scheduling application had notifications, so that they would not
            have to constantly refresh the page to see if there were any updates to their calendar (high frequency
            word “calendar” shown in <b>Figure 4</b>). From this, we uncovered that users do like to have
            notifications,
            however, what kind of notifications and at what frequency should be customizable to each user.

        <strong>Usability Evaluation</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Visual Design</div>
          <p>
            One main visual design issue that we discovered was the use of overlapping time slots when creating and
            voting on a poll in week view. <b>Figure 6 and 7 </b>show examples of what overlapping times will look like
            in week
            view from a poll creator and a participant respectively. When a user is trying to create a series of
            available times and then have participants vote on those times, the overlap makes it quite difficult to see
            when the time slot ends. The inability to see when a time slot ends could lead a user to select the
            incorrect time. One of our usability test participants stated, “For the most part it was simple but visuals
            on calendar page were confusing especially when you overlap slots”. This type of overlap can lead to user
            error and can make it quite difficult to review, especially if a poll creator is giving several time slot
            options on several days.

          <div class="header-dark">Confusing and Unclear Labels</div>
          <p>
            When creating a poll, users generally have an idea of what type they would like to create: one that shows
            availabilities and one that reveals opinions. Doodle represents these options as “Week,” “Month,” and
            “Text.” When prompted to create a Doodle asking for availabilities for three days, 2 out of 6 participants
            selected “Text” and manually listed Monday through Friday for their event (Figure 8). The participants could
            have easily selected the “Week” or “Month” option to select dates shown on a calendar (Figure 9). However,
            the three labels are ambiguous as to what they represent and do not provide context in the interface until
            selected.

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Ambiguity</div>
          <p>
            The last of Doodle’s issues that arose from our findings was ambiguous options. Doodle has a number of
            common and useful functionalities for getting a specific task done. The issue lies in how a user finds out
            about them. For example, one of our usability testers, when creating a poll, wanted to let participants know
            to only vote once , so they wrote a note on the poll specifying those instructions. However, Doodle polls
            already have the option to only allow one vote per person. The user wouldn't know about this functionality
            because it appears towards the end of poll creation.
            <p>
              It is also confusing for users to know where to click when trying to create a poll. After our usability
              testers successfully logged in, there is a tiny blue button with add sign showing “create a doodle” on the
              upper left corner. The name was not quite fit with our scenario requested. However, there was also a class
              called “create new poll ” with three possible choices. So our usability testers thought the solution is
              among those three choices, which makes them even confused to understand the differences among “Schedule an
              Event”, “Make a Choice” and “Schedule a 1:1 Meeting”.

            </p>
            <p>
              Our biggest finding in terms of ambiguity is in scheduling a 1:1 meeting. Scheduling a one-on-one meeting
              is one of the three main categories of poll creation. But in order to complete such a poll, it requires
              users to integrate their calendar. Even if the user selects “I will do this later,” Doodle prevents the
              user from proceeding until they integrate their calendar. Polls don’t have instructions for creating them,
              which leaves users confused on how to make them. The vagueness of requirements for this kind of poll
              didn’t allow one of our usability users to create a 1:1 poll.
