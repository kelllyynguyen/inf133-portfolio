        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          Doodle is an online calendar tool best utilized for time management and planning group sessions. Targeted for
          people that need to collaborate, this product allows groups to set their availability and displays what times
          are most convenient for the majority of the team. Doodle has made it easier to solve the problem of figuring
          out the best time to meet, but it isn't a top choice for scheduling purposes. Therefore, my team and I wanted
          to create a redesign for Doodle using a user-centered design process. We conducted surveys, interviews, and
          usability tests and designed redesigned mockups based on our findings.

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          My role was a UX Designer. I collaborated with 5 other group members to complete this redesign. I was involved
          in the surveying and interviewing processes to understand how users schedule with others. I synthesized the
          data and
          helped determine which features needed redesigning. I drew sketches and created high-fidelity mockups to
          reflect
          the changes.

          Our study objectives are specific things that we

          high-level questions that will guide our research and help us to understand our users and their experiences.

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">
            Interviews
          </div>
          <p>
            Our in-person interview was comprised of two sections: <b>general questions</b> and
            <b>application-specific
              questions</b>.
            We also included a section for people who had no familiarity with scheduling applications. On average, our
            in-person interviews were 30 minutes long.
          </p>
          <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
          <div class="header-dark">Surveys</div>
          <p>Our survey questions were very similar to our in-person interview questions, but rephrased to obtain
            <b>quantitative data</b>. We asked questions that considered the individual’s position when coordinating
            (e.g.
            planner, participant, or both) to see if there were any relationships with their position and methods or
            preferred application.

        <strong>Usability Evaluation</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Cognitive Walkthrough</div>
          <p>
            We focused on three tasks:
            <ol>
              <li>Creating a poll</li>
              <li>Editing a poll</li>
              <li>Closing the poll and exporting data</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>We chose to create a poll as a task because it serves as a basis for what users primarily use
            Doodle for. Then, we wanted to edit a poll to see the sequence of actions and how it differs from a poll
            creation. Our last task focused on closing the poll and exporting it to Excel so that poll creators can view
            the responses on a spreadsheet document.
          </p>
          <p>To identify any potential usability problems, we answered a set of
            four questions per each tasks’ step. We recorded any potential errors or usability issues that we ran
            through when performing these tasks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Usability Tests</div>

          <p>
            Our goals for the usability tests were to see how participants utilize different views and functionalities
            for each task.
            We focused on six tasks, half were focused on poll creation and half on poll participation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our first task had users create a text poll to make a tally of cake flavors for an office
            party. This allowed users to use Doodle as a poll service in addition to an event scheduling tool. The next
            two tasks asked the participants to create
            scheduled slot times with certain restrictions. The last three tasks were simple; they prompted the
            participants to pick preferred options in different types of polls.

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <strong>User Research</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <div class="subsection">

          <div class="header-dark">Group Size and System Preferences</div>
          <p>
            Many participants had a preferred system for coordinating meetings with others. About 50% of participants
            said they directly message people to coordinate plans instead of using a scheduling service. We reached
            the conclusion that these groups are small enough that finding a time to meet is enough without a
            scheduling application. Of the participants that coordinate with a larger number of people, they used a
            scheduling service, such as when2meet. This brought an interesting notion to our research that people use
            scheduling applications for more “business-like” meetings and direct message for casual groupings.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Figure 1</b> below shows that people who have coordinated and/or participated in certain events have a
            preferred system they use in order to coordinate specific times to meet up. Those who had participated in
            a number of different types of events generally had used a scheduling service in order to keep track of
            their availability.

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">The Effect of Uncooperative People on Coordination</div>
          <p>
            Because group meetings depend on the participants, meeting coordinators have a difficult time with
            uncooperative people. This could be a limitation in the other members’ schedules because of available
            meeting times. We came to this conclusion from asking “What is challenging about coordinating a time to
            meet with others?. Their responses can be seen in <b>Figure 2</b> with a world cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agreeing on the date is another major problem, as
            some people can be unresponsive or have a lack of commitment. In this context, we define scheduling as
            coordinating group meetings using a given application. There are some pain points that are attributed to
            the features (or lack of) in a certain application. One participant said that having to coordinate across
            application platforms to view availabilities is hard when individuals’ schedules change.

          <p>
            Another sentiment a few of the participants interviewed expressed is that they like to keep their schedule
            organized. Many said that they view their schedule or calendar on a weekly, sometimes even hourly basis.
            We concluded that they want to organize their schedules in such a way that would make it easy to know when
            they are available for group meetings. A good portion of the participants use Google Calendar or a
            physical planner to keep track of their availability. Of the 19 participants that use a scheduling
            application, more than half used a physical/digital calendar, seen in <b>Figure 3</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to sync schedules across multiple platforms interested the interviewees. One of the interview
            questions read, “Is calendar integration important to you?” to which five of the thirteen participants
            responded yes. The team deduced that the reason for interest comes from recurring events that students
            have, such as club meetings, classes, and group events. Users need to keep track of their personal
            schedule, and an online calendar was the most common scheduling tool among respondents.

            We asked our participants if they would like to have notifications when using a scheduling application. To
            which most of our interviewees said that they prefer to have notifications (high frequency words
            “automatically” and “upcoming” are displayed in <b>Figure 4</b>). However, some stated that they preferred
            application notifications, and some stated that they preferred email notifications. One participant even
            stated that they wished their current scheduling application had notifications, so that they would not
            have to constantly refresh the page to see if there were any updates to their calendar (high frequency
            word “calendar” shown in <b>Figure 4</b>). From this, we uncovered that users do like to have
            notifications,
            however, what kind of notifications and at what frequency should be customizable to each user.

        <strong>Cognitive Walkthrough</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <div class="subsection">
          <p>
            Overall, we found Doodle is a system that relies too heavily on the user’s knowledge of similar systems. As
            a first time user, there is not enough feedback given by the system to guide the user in the right
            direction. If the user has an error, the system does not inform the user of any problems. An example of this
            is if you leave the Doodle empty, the “Continue” button will be grayed out but not state the reason why.

        <strong>Usability Evaluation</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>

        <div class="subsection">
          <div class="header-dark">Visual Design</div>
          <p>
            The visual design pain points that our group discovered occurred on both the Poll Creator and the
            Participant side. One of the key issues that each of our six usability test participants identified was
            Doodle’s use of advertising within the user experience. While ad placement plays a key role in developing
            revenue for a company, it should not disturb the user while they are navigating through a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Figure 5</b> displays an example of one of Doodle’s landing pages when creating a poll. Not only
            are they quite distracting, but the size of the advertisements themselves are quite large, especially the
            advertisements on the users left and right side. One of the usability test participants accidentally
            clicked an advertisement twice during their experience, once when creating a poll and once when voting on
            a poll. A simple mistake like this leads to pop ups and user frustration, and can overall be quite
            intrusive.
          </p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/doodle/figure5.png" />
          <div class="img-caption">Figure 5: A word cloud that utilizes the data of the question “What do you like

          </div>

          <div class="spacer"></div>

          <p>
            Another main visual design issue that we discovered was the use of overlapping time slots when creating and
            voting on a poll in week view. <b>Figure 6 and 7 </b>show examples of what overlapping times will look like
            in week
            view from a poll creator and a participant respectively. When a user is trying to create a series of
            available times and then have participants vote on those times, the overlap makes it quite difficult to see
            when the time slot ends. The inability to see when a time slot ends could lead a user to select the
            incorrect time. One of our usability test participants stated, “For the most part it was simple but visuals
            on calendar page were confusing especially when you overlap slots”. This type of overlap can lead to user
            error and can make it quite difficult to review, especially if a poll creator is giving several time slot
            options on several days.
