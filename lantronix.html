        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          ConsoleFlow is cloud and on-premise hosted management software that securely connects you to your console
          managers and attached IT equipment. This software aggregates data into a centralized directory for accessing
          all connected devices in a data center, development lab or a remote branch office. This project consisted of
          the merge of two software products, which required a user interface facelift and design decisions for the
          merged features and
          functionalities.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          My role was a UX Designer. I filled the spot of the previous full-time UX Designer and completed designing the
          remaining mockups. I collaborated closely with the product line manager and engineers to make sure that the
          designs followed the product vision and that development was consistent with the design.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <h3 class="focus">"How do we merge two existing applications into one?"</h3>
        <p>
          The previous application, MACH10, was to be merged into ConsoleFlow. However, operations like firmware updates
          and configuration updates were in their own separate tab in MACH10. In the original ConsoleFlow, all
          operations were done on the Explore page, where users view a list of all devices first.
        </p>
        <img data-enlargable class="img-fluid zoom-img" src="assets/consoleflow/figure1-1.png" />

      </div>

      <div class="project-section">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <strong>Divide user operations into their respective sections.</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          I decided to follow MACH10’s way of organizing user operations into their own tab because users perform
          task-based operations. If they want to send a CLI command to a device, they go to the respective tab and
          select the device(s) they wish to perform the operation on. I also chose to structure the application this way
          because of future pricing model requirements that would show/hide add-on operations.
        </p>

        </div>


        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <strong>Develop a design with consistent user flows for each operation.</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Consistency was so important to me during this design. There were many inconsistent flows throughout the
          operations. For example, firmware updates for MACH10 could only be performed on device groups, which were
          queried by a search string. Firmware updates for the previous ConsoleFlow required individual device
          selection. There needed to be a consistent way of selecting devices for all operations, so I spent a lot of
          time making sure flows made sense.

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <strong>Extend design for upcoming features.</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          As the product continues to develop, new features will be added. I had to think about the question, “How would
          a newly added feature affect the existing design?” There were a lot of things I had to keep in the back of my
          mind so that newly added features wouldn’t conflict with my design.

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <strong>Prioritization of aspects of the design</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Although I wanted to produce a thorough design for each operation, project deadlines were coming quickly and
          engineers had to prioritize aspects of the design. There were technical limitations that the engineers had to
          address before changing the front-end, so design decisions were pushed back until the later releases.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <strong>Modularizing content while still keeping user needs in mind</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          One of the engineers pointed out that separating operations into their own tabs makes simple processes
          annoyingly difficult. I thought of the use cases where a user wanted to perform an action on multiple devices
          or device groups, but not the simple cases of performing an action on a single device. I decided to put simple
          operations within the device view because there were existing tabs for each operation.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <strong>Two different customer bases</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Although MACH10 users would be familiar with the new ConsoleFlow operations, existing ConsoleFlow users would
          have to get used to the new user interface. I had to communicate regularly with the project manager and
          engineers to ensure that the new design would not prevent users from performing tasks with the user interface
          facelift.

        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <strong>Communication</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Communication between product line managers, backend engineers, and front-end engineers is extremely
          important. I had to make sure that the back-end engineers were able to carry out my design, but also ensure
          that the front-end engineers were following my design carefully. If there were some inconsistencies, I would
          file issues to make sure changes were made.
        </p>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <strong>Mockups allow visualization of requirements</strong>
        <div class="mini-spacer"></div>
        <p>
          Deliverables are needed during the requirements elicitation process so engineers can understand how to develop
          for the application. Requirements can be hard to visualize when there is no design. The engineers preferred
          having mockups to see how requirements would look on the user interface. I had to make sure I was on top of my
          deliverables so that development wouldn’t be pushed behind.
