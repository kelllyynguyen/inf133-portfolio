      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <h3>Users have a difficult time finding our products.</h3>

      <p>

        After the acquisition of two companies, Lantronix struggled with organizing its portfolio of products into an
        easy-to-navigate product hierarchy that was clear to site visitors - both old and new.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many users told me that they were getting frustrated because they were
        <strong>spending too long trying to find a product</strong> and <strong>couldn't remember how to get to a
          certain product page.</strong>

      </p>

      <p>
        Users in this context are <strong>anyone</strong> that interacts with our website, including our distributors,
        value-added resellers, investors, customers, even our <strong>internal sales and marketing team.</strong>

      </p>

      <p>
        I can recall multiple meetings where a coworker would share their screen to show something on a product page,
        but
        would get lost in the process. And others in the meeting would have to help out by saying exactly where to hover
        or click.

      <h1>User Research</h1>
      <h2>How do users find our products on the website?</h2>

      <p>My first objective was trying to understand exactly <strong>how users navigated through our website to find a
          product.</strong>
        There are a number of ways to find our products: using the search bar, the navigation menu,
        product category pages, a product index, and "filter all products" page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to see which method was the most common and exactly what steps users take for their preferred method.

      <p>
        I chose to conduct <strong>unmoderated usability testing</strong> because it would allow me to observe users
        every step and hear their thought process (via think-aloud protocol).
      </p>

      <p>Not only was it important for me to observe the usability of the interface components on the website, but also
        dig deeper into <strong>potential information architecture problems</strong> due to new products being added
        onto the website.
        Therefore, I included tasks involving products belonging to different high-level categories (e.g. Embedded
        Solutions,
        External Gateways, Software Services) </p>

      <p><b>Example Task</b><br />You are interested in Lantronix's tracking device, the FOX3. How would you find it on
        our website?

      <h1>Key Findings</h1>
      <h2>Hovering interactions for the navigation menu caused users to commit errors.</h2>

      <p>
        3 out of 7 participants accidentally clicked on a menu item when they meant to hover over it, causing them
        multiple tries to complete a task.
      </p>



      <h2>Participants had difficulty viewing what was underneath a product category.</h2>

      <p>
        Because each product category has many subcategories, users repeatedly navigated down the tree in hopes that the
        product or category they're looking for shows up.
      </p>

      <h2>Not everyone is familiar with our products and what categories they fall under.</h2>

      <p>
        For example, the xPort is a device server, but some participants couldn't recall if it was a server or gateway.
        Therefore, a lot of time was spent exploring the menu items.

      <h1>The Solution</h1>
      <h2>Reorganize the product hierarchy into categories that make sense.</h2>

      <p>
        For example, all of the products from our acquired company, Intrinsyc, were lumped together into "Intelligent
        Edge Solutions," which doesn't provide enough context to users.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked collaboratively with product line management and marketing to come up with product category names that
        were <strong>a) intuitive to customers</strong> and <strong>b) cohesive among product lines</strong>.

      <h2>Redesign the hierarchy to display content in a "flatter" fashion.</h2>

      <p>
        This would hope to solve the "guessing" game a lot of participants were playing in the usability test and reduce
        the amount of interaction required to view subcategories and products.

      <h1>Challenges</h1>
      <h2>Adapting the design due to WordPress plugin constraints.</h2>

      <p>
        The WordPress plugin did not allow us to follow the design exactly as intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content window would not change dynamically, and would retain the height of the category with the tallest
        height. As a result, a large amount of whitespace is shown on menus with few products.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reduce time to production, I designed an alternative option to fill the whitespace with marketing content to
        help promote content related to our products, e.g. blog posts, case studies, and featured images.

      <h2>Usability testing on staging environment</h2>
      <p>
        Visual design is only one portion of improving the information architecture on the navigation menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the web development team completes re-categorization of products, another layer of testing must be done to
        see if the visual design and product categorization has improved the user experience.
