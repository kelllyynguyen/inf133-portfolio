                <h2>Project Brief</h2>
                <p>
                    Dreams for Schools is a non-profit organization that makes STEM accessible and approachable. They
                    hold
                    many educational programs, their largest being AppJam+. AppJam+ is a mentorship program where
                    college
                    students teach middle school students how to build a mobile app. Our sponsors run multiple sessions
                    of
                    AppJam+ throughout the year and coordinate with 200+ instructors in total.
                    As a result, the program coordinators are overloaded with responding to instructors that belong to
                    different schools and their current system was no longer effective.
                    To solve this, we partnered with them to continue an ongoing project to build an internal web and
                    mobile
                    application so they could manage

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    My primary role was a full stack developer. I managed the database using MySQL and updated calls to
                    the server based on changes we made. In parallel, I designed mockups for the features requested by
                    our sponsors and wrote code to match the design. During development, I coordinated usability tests
                    from both user types: Dreams for Schools admins and instructors.

                <strong>Learning React Native</strong>
                <div class="subsection">
                    Prior to this project, I had no experience with React or React Native. I only had experience with
                    basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some front-end development libraries like Angular and Bootstrap.

                <strong>Downloading and running existing code</strong>
                <div class="subsection">
                    The existing mobile app project had been passed down by two teams. We installed three
                    repositories: web, server, and mobile. Although my focus was working on the server and mobile
                    app, I helped out some group members with the web app as well.

                <strong>Requirements Elicitation</strong>
                <div class="subsection">
                    We met with our project sponsors to establish which features the existing project had, and to
                    gain insight on what new features would be requested. During this elicitation process, we found
                    that a lot of the code that was previously written was hard-coded. Therefore, we had to start
                    referencing more information being stored in the database and accurately make calls to the
                    server.

                <div class="subsection">
                    Many of the screens were already coded and followed a consistent style. With low-fidelity mockups,
                    we illustrated screens into greater detail to display how content would look to the users. We
                    created screens for the following features: Login, Registration, Announcements (Create and Details)
                    and Check-In.

                    <div class="header">Users</div>
                    <p>
                        We decided to use two different databases, our own and Firebase because Firebase has
                        authentication services that we could use. We took out the password column from our
                        database and
                        stored it in Firebase instead so we wouldn’t have to worry about encryption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using Expo Notifications, I assigned them a Push Token so that the Expo Notifications
                        API knows
                        which device to send the notification to.
                    </p>

                    <div class="header">Announcement Replies</div>
                    <p>
                        Announcement replies were an entirely new feature, so we had to create a new table for
                        it. I modified the existing announcements table to include an array of announcement
                        replies, and the replies would be loaded when using an announcement ID as a query.
                    </p>

                    <div class="header">Check-In</div>
                    <p>
                        Originally, check-in only had timestamps, but our clients wanted us to implement
                        geolocation. I used the Google Maps API to obtain the user’s coordinates and translate
                        that into an address to be displayed to the user.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="mini-spacer"></div>

                <strong>Front-End</strong>
                <div class="mini-spacer"></div>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <div class="header">Announcements</div>
                    <p>
                        For this page, I made an API call to retrieve all of the announcements and loaded them
                        into
                        a FlatList. FlatList uses scroll loading which is better for performance than displaying
                        the
                        entire list of announcements. It also has the pull to refresh function so after users
                        are
                        done scrolling, they can refresh to check if new announcements were posted.
                        Additionally, we
                        had a live search feature that can filter the announcements based on title, body, or
                        name.
                        In iOS, the search bar has a clear icon to remove the search query. Lastly, we have
                        announcement banner notifications that users see when the app is inactive. The title is
                        “New
                        Announcement” and the body is a preview of the announcement.

                    <div class="header">Check-In</div>
                    <p>
                        This screen makes a call to the API with the user’s ID as the query. It shows all the
                        check-ins related to that user and displays them in another FlatList with cards. The
                        list automatically updates after clicking “Check-In” and is displayed in reverse
                        chronological order.

                    <div class="header">Consistency matters</div>
                    <p>

                        We had some inconsistent buttons and styling because different
                        developers were
                        working on different features. One of our participants suggested that we made everything
                        consistent
                        with our design. To do this, I separated the stylesheet into its own file instead of referencing
                        a
                        stylesheet
                        defined in each component. This way, all our buttons would look the same, and it would be easier
                        to change the style in one place as opposed to many places.

                    <p>
                        Registration includes a lot of text inputs. Sometimes, users enter
                        incorrect information
                        in these inputs, such as email or password. I created validation checks to make sure users were
                        entering non-school email addresses and passwords greater than 6 characters. The validation
                        checked
                        if the text field was out of focus, and then displayed an error message on top of the field. If
                        there were no errors, the user could click on the Register button.

                        One participant explained the way they’d use Announcements and suggested
                        improvements.
                        For
                        example, they noted that they probably wouldn’t look at all the announcements - only the ones
                        that
                        are created by program admins. She suggested having the list emphasize announcements created by
                        admins and to be able to filter announcements by name. We incorporated her suggestions in our
                        next

                    I didn’t realize how difficult it would be to understand another persons’ code.
                    I thought most code is self-explanatory if you understand how to code. However, I would’ve
                    appreciated
                    documentation or comments to explain exactly what lines of code did and what their purpose was.
                    After
                    finishing the project, I documented the code that I worked on so the next group would have a better

                    The important of a reliable back-end. I had never done back-end development before. I
                    didn’t
                    think it would be that challenging, but I was definitely wrong! There is a lot of detail work to
                    make
                    sure the right parameters are being used and to give meaningful error codes and messages. I would
                    often
                    make adjustments to the backend, and the web team would have to make changes to their front-end code
                    to
                    match my fixes.

                <p>
                    Users aren’t always going to be enabled or approved on the
                    system.
                    They’re going to be deleted eventually by the program admins. But what should happen after they’re
                    deleted? If there isn’t a clear direction on what’s supposed to happen, front-end development is
                    affected. Many references to objects are now null because it’s removed from the database, so the
                    front-end can’t successfully display content. Looking back, I should’ve asked more questions on what
                    to
                    do for the user account lifecycle so I could write better code.
